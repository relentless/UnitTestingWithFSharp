UnitTestingWithFSharp
=====================

Examples from my short talk about using F# as a unit testing language.  This was inspired by Phil Tralford's post [http://trelford.com/blog/post/fstestlang.aspx](F# as a Unit Testing Language).

It compares writing unit tests in F# using [https://github.com/fsharp/FsUnit](fsUnit) (and [http://trelford.com/blog/post/Foq.aspx](Foq)) with those written in C# using [http://www.nunit.org/](NUnit) (and [https://github.com/Moq/moq](Moq)).
