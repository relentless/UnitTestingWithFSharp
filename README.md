UnitTestingWithFSharp
=====================

Examples from my short talk about using F# as a unit testing language.  This was inspired by Phil Tralford's post [F# as a Unit Testing Language](http://trelford.com/blog/post/fstestlang.aspx).

It compares writing unit tests in F# using [fsUnit](https://github.com/fsharp/FsUnit) (and [Foq](http://trelford.com/blog/post/Foq.aspx)) with those written in C# using [NUnit](http://www.nunit.org/) (and [Moq](https://github.com/Moq/moq)).
